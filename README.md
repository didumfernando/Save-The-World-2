# Save-The-World-2
Term 2 Coding Project Â®didumfernando, yingxuan, shibo

Description: This project is our Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior project which is a web application which makes use of our own Machine Learning AI as well as Open AI to calculate the risk score of a patient of getting heart and cardiovascular diseases based on the users input of age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking status. The Machine Learning calculates the risk score and the Open AI uses the risk score and the user's input to generate a personalised recommendation plan for the user to improve his/her health (Figure 1).

## AI Concepts 
The AI would use the following algorithm shown in Figure 2 pictorially to accurately diagnose the risk levels and suggest the recommend actions for each of the groups (red - high risk, yellow - medium risk, green- low risk)
